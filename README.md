## Key Features
  - **Plug&Play** - one line installation with Docker.
  - **Scan various sources** containing a set of keywords, e.g. `ORGANIZATION-NAME.com`.
    
    Currently supports:
    - GitHub
      - Repositories
      - Gists _(coming soon)_
    - Paste sites (e.g., PasteBin) _(coming soon)_
  - **Filter results** with a built-in heuristic engine.
  - **Enhance results with IOLs** (Indicators Of Leak):
      - Secrets in the found sources (including Git repos commits history):
        - With [Shhgit][1] (using a customized rules list).
        - With [TruffleHog][3].
      - URIs (Including indication of your organization's domains)
      - Emails (Including indication of your organization's email addresses)
      - Contributors
      - Sensitive keywords (e.g., canary token, internal domains)
  - Allows to **ignore** public sources, (e.g., "junk" repositories by web crawlers).
  - **OOTB ignore list** of common "junk" sources.
  - **Acknowledge a leak**, and only get notified if the source has been modified since the previous scan.
  - **Built-in ELK** to search for data in leaks (including full index of Git repositories with IOLs).
  - **Notify on new leaks**
    - MS Teams Webhook.
    - Slack Bot.
    - Cortex XSOARÂ® (by Palo Alto Networks) Integration _(WIP)_.

## Technology Stack
- Fully Dockerized.
- API-first Python Flask backend.
- Decoupled Vue.js (3.x) frontend.
- SQLite DB.
- Async tasks with Celery + Redis queues.

## Prerequisites
  - Docker-Compose

## Installation
  - Clone the repository
  - Create a local .env file
    ```bash
    cd Leaktopus
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  - Edit .env according to your local setup (see the internal comments).
  - Run Leaktopus
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  - Initiate the installation sequence by accessing the installation API.
    Just open http://{LEAKTOPUS_HOST}:8000/api/install in your browser.
  - Check that the API is up and running at http://{LEAKTOPUS_HOST}:8000/up
  - The UI should be available at http://{LEAKTOPUS_HOST}:8080


### Using Github App
In addition to the basic personal access token option, Leaktopus supports Github App authentication.
Using Github App is recommended due to the increased rate limits.

1. To use Github App authentication, you need to create a Github App and install it on your organization/account.
  See [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app) for more details.

1. After creating the app, you need to set the following environment variables:
    - `GITHUB_USE_APP=True`
    - `GITHUB_APP_ID`
    - `GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID` - The installation id can be found in [your app installation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74474953/533842).
    - `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` (defaults to `/app/private-key.pem`)

1. Mount the private key file to the container (see `docker-compose.yml` for an example).
  `./leaktopus_backend/private-key.pem:/app/private-key.pem`

_* Note that `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` will be ignored if `GITHUB_USE_APP` is set to `True`._

## Updating Leaktopus
If you wish to update your Leaktopus version (pulling a newer version), just follow the next steps.

  - Pull the latest version.
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
  - Rebuild Docker images (data won't be deleted).
    ```bash
    # Force image recreation
    docker-compose up --force-recreate --build
    ```
  - Run the DB update by calling its API (should be required after some updates).
  http://{LEAKTOPUS_HOST}/api/updatedb

## Results Filtering Heuristic Engine
The built-in heuristic engine is filtering the search results to reduce false positives by:
- Content:
    - More than X emails containing non-organizational domains.
    - More than X URIs containing non-organizational domains.
- Metadata:
    - More than X stars.
    - More than X forks.
- Sources ignore list.

## Security Notes
As for now, Leaktopus does not provide any authentication mechanism.
Make sure that you are not exposing it to the world, and doing your best to **restrict access to your Leaktopus instance(s)**.
